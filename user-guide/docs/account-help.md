# Account Help

## Password Reset

To **reset your password**, go to [https://accounts.tacc.utexas.edu/forgot_password](https://accounts.tacc.utexas.edu/forgot_password), and then enter your username or email address that is associated with your user account, and you will receive an email with a password reset link. 

## Account Activation

If you receive an **Authentication Failed** error when logging in, and you are confident that you have entered the correct password for your account, then it is likely that you need to **Reactivate Account** due to your account being Deactivated due to more than 120 days having passed since you last logged in. To reactivate your account, log in at accounts.tacc.utexas.edu and then request an activation link via [https://accounts.tacc.utexas.edu/activate](https://accounts.tacc.utexas.edu/activate). You will receive an email at the email address associated with your user account with instructions for account reactivation.
